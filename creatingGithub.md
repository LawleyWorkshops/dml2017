# Creating Your Own Content on GitHub

There are two primary ways to provide non-code content on GitHub. One way is to use its built-in web page creation tools [(GitHub Pages)](https://pages.github.com/) to create a website with your content. I won't be covering that in this workshop. The other way, which is what I'll be showing (and what you're currently using), is creating human-readable documents directly in a repository by using a simple markup language called Markdown.
