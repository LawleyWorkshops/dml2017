# 4. Using Slack

Slack workspaces can be set up with a generic invitation link for joining (like this one), which has an expiration date (in this case, October 9th). They can also be set up with individual invitation links that are emailed to users. And finally, they can be set up to allow anyone with an email address in a specific domain to join, which is what I use for my classes. 

I've created an invitation link for joining the workspace for this workshop, which will expire on October 9th: http://links.lawley.net/joinDML (Because invitation links are a little unwieldy, I used a link shortener on my domain to redirect to the invitation; that also lets me replace the invitation URL with a new one if necessary.) 

Once you've created an account and logged in, you should see something like this:

Now that you've got an account, you'll be able to return to the workspace in the future by using this URL: https://dml2017-lawley.slack.com/ (keep in mind, however, that I generally don't stay logged into Slacks from past classes and events, so while it's a fine way to explore the features, it won't be a good way to reach me directly). 

I've done only a small amount of customization on this workspace. Click on the heading for **Channels** (not the plus sign; that creates a new channel!), to see a list of available channels. In additio to the two channels (\#general and \#random) that are created by default in a new workspace, there should be two additional channels visible to you: \#introductions and \#github. Go ahead and join the \#introductions channel, and post a brief intro there. When you're done, take a look at the \#github channel. 



Getting students to use new tools can be a challenge, so I've done a couple of things to increase widespread use by my students. 
- First, I use the main announcement channel to let them know about useful things, like upcoming deadlines, extensions on due dates, and why I might be a few minutes late for class; that gives them a good reason to set up the mobile client and enable notifications. 
- Second, I create some informal channels that they find engaging--like a music suggestions channel where they can post songs they'd like me to add to the class playlist (which I play on in the background when they're working on in-class exercises). 
- Third, early in the semester I have an exercise that requires them to post to the \#introductions channel, so I can be sure they've set up an account and figured out how to join a channel. 
- Fourth, there are a few things I tell them I will only respond to via Slack--for instance, if I offer an opportunity for them to resubmit a project with a low grade, I'll say they need to contact me via Slack to request that I regrade the new version.
- Most importantly, I've made a commitment to respond quickly to student messages. The way I've managed this without getting overwhelmed is to check notifications several times a day and quickly acknowledge any incoming messages--but to mark messages for later response if it's not something that can be immediately responded to. At the end of the day, I take the time to go through and respond to the marked messages. 
- Oh...and I've added a link to the Slack workspace in the main navigation of the class in the LMS (along with a link to the class GitHub repo). 

I have not stopped using email for communicating with students, of course. Anything that I need a "paper trail" on--warnings about grades, requests to meet with them in my office hours, etc--still gets sent by email. I want them to see Slack as an informal and quick way to make requests and get help, and its immediacy and relative ephemerality helps with that.
