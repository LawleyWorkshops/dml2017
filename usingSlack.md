# 3. Using Slack for Class Communication

Many LMS systems provide group and private chat options now, and our students certainly don't lack for real-time communication tools to talk to us and each other. So why add another tool to the mix? And why Slack in particular?

- RIT is a co-op education school, which means our students go out on semester-long work experiences several times during their degree. Many of them will end up at companies using Slack, so this gives them hands-on experience with an important productivity tool.
- Slack has excellent mobile clients, which is typically the very best way to reach my students. (As we all know, email is pretty low on the list of ways to get your students' attention quickly.)
- Slack's integrations, especially with Google Docs, GitHub, and Trello, are extremely useful in my classes, where those services are also an important part of the instructional technology used. 
- Slack makes it easy for students to upload the files they want me to look at, and displays/formats code snippets as well
- I can easily create private group chat channels for student groups, and be a member of those channels, which helps greatly in assessing ongoing participation and group dynamics issues
- It's easy for me to add external people to a Slack workspace, which comes in handy when I've got a class working on a project with outside experts. 

One of the biggest drawbacks of using any type of real-time messaging with active groups, of course, is that it can turn into a major source of productivity-killing interruptions. That's why for years I've avoided using it for most work-related activities. However, when I use it with students, it allows me prioritize their questions over the mountains of less important (but still non-spam) email I get every day. To keep that under control, however, the *only* Slack workspaces I check regularly are the ones for my currently active classe--and once the term is over, I stop checking the workspaces entirely. (I'll still respond to former students' questions, of course, but they do lose their "priority access" to me. ) 

Getting students (or any group!) to adopt new communication tools can be a challenge, and the first time I tried using Slack in the classroom it wasn't as successful as I'd hoped. Since then, I've started doing a number of things to increase its use my students. 

For privacy reasons, I can't give you a live tour of my class workspaces, but I've created anonymized screenshots to illustrate some of my approaches.

### Preventing Notification Spam
One of the biggest problems with having students (or anyone else) adopt a new chat tool is the risk that they'll have to deal with too much unwanted/unnecessary chatter. But if students don't install the mobile client and turn on notifications, they'll lose much of the value of the tool. 

To address that problem, I renamed the \#general channel (which all new users are automatically subscribed to by default) to \#announcements, and set it so that only my TAs and I can post to it. I use that channel to let them know about useful things, like upcoming deadlines, extensions on due dates, and why I might be a few minutes late for class; that gives them a good reason to set up the mobile client and enable notifications. Because nobody but the TAs and I can post there, they don't mind keeping notifications turned on for that channel.

I also walk them through how to change notifications for the workspace, so that they don't get constant notifications from channels that are lower priority. 

### Inviting Information Engagement
In each class workspace, I create at least one non-classwork channel that invites playful participation--this semester I created a music suggestions channel where they can post songs they'd like me to add to the class playlist (which I play on in the background when they're working on in-class exercises).

### Requiring an Introduction
To nudge students into setting up an account and using it to post content, I assign an exercise at the start of the term that requires them to post to the \#introductions channel, so I can be sure they've set up an account and figured out how to join a channel. In my web class, I also use this as a way to collect their GitHub usernames, which I will need later in the term.

### Slack-Only Opportunities
I tell students that they're welcome to continue using email to contact for me for course related issues, and that after the initial introduction exercise is done they can choose not to check Slack again. However, I also do offer some "bonus" opportunities for those who do use Slack--for instance, when I recently offered my web design students the opportunity to resubmit a project for an improved grade, I told them that they needed to contact me via Slack (and include a link) to request that I regrade their revision.

### Easy Access to Slack (and GitHub) from LMS
Our LMS (Brightspace, formerly D2L, allows customization of the navigation bar for a class. I added custom links to both the GitHub repo and the Slack workspace from that, as well as adding a prominent "news" item on the first page with links to both.

### Committment to Quick Responses
Most importantly, I've committed to responding quickly to student messages. I have the Slack client on my phone's home screen, and I check for new notifications at least twice a day. If a message can be answered quickly, I do it then. If not, I acknowledge it, let them know I'll get back to them, and mark it with a star for later access. When I have a little more time, I go through my starred messages and respond in more depth. 

(The example below also shows how easy it is for them to share code with me in their messages.)

## Slack vs Email
I have not stopped using email for communicating with students, of course. Anything that I might need a "paper trail" on--warnings about grades, requests to meet with them in my office hours, etc--still gets sent by email. And there are definitely students who prefer using a familiar mode of communication to contact me. 

Ideally, though, I want my students to see Slack as an easy and non-threatening environment to ask questions, make comments, and get help. I tell them (and it's true) that it allows me to prioritize their messages over the piles of email that I get on a daily basis. And I've found that once I get them over the adoption hump, most of them appreciate Slack's informality and ephemerality. Most importantly, I hear from far more students who have questions or concerns than I did in the past.
