# 2. Using GitHub for Course Materials

If you're reading this, you're already using GitHub. Congratulations! 

This is as much "using GitHub" as your students will need to do. If it's a public repository, they don't even need a GitHub account to access the materials. I use a repo for the course materials in my [freshman survey class on Interactive Media], and we never talk at all about git or how to create or modify files in a repository--it's simply a server that I use to publish materials for my students. 

So, if all I'm doing is publishing read-only materials for students, why use GitHub rather than our university's learning management system? Several reasons. 

First, I often receive requests from students and colleagues at RIT who would like to see what material my course covers. It's a cumbersome process to add each interested person individually to a specific section of the course in the LMS, and make sure their permissions are set properly.

Second, I also receive requests from people *outside* of RIT who are interested in my course materials, but can't be given access to the LMS. These fall into several categories:
- Faculty members at other schools who are interested in reviewing my materials and possibly adapting them for their own use, something that I encourage (most of my materials are CC-licensed). 
- Alumni who no longer have accounts on the LMS, but want access to up-to-date versions of my materials and links.
- People who'd like to do one or more of the exercises or tutorials that I've posted, for their own learning. 

I could address most of those needs by simply putting my materials up on my university or personal website--which is what I actually did for years. In fact, back in 2004 I actually [created instructions on how to mod Movable Type (the most popular blogging platform before WordPress took over) as a courseware system](http://mamamusings.net/archives/2004/01/06/mt_courseware_stepbystep.php). And if all I wanted to do was *publish* the materials, that would still work fine. 

However, I don't just want to publish my materials. I also want to invite others to build on them, and to share their additions and corrections back with me when they do. In other words, I want to treat my course materials like open source software! 

So, how does this work? 

Let's take a look at the GitHub repos for the classes I'm teaching this semester--[Introduction to Interactive Media](https://github.com/LawleyFall2017/110-fall2017) and [Web Design & Implementation](https://github.com/LawleyFall2017/230-fall2017). You'll see that I use the repos to distribute my syllabus, schedule of topics and readings, in-class/homework exercises, and project assignments. What I *don't* use them for is anything that's private (and FERPA-protected)--classlists, grades, and discussions. The grade-related information, including online quizzes and dropboxes for assignments, are the only thing I still keep in the LMS. Discussions have all moved to Slack, which we'll talk about in a few minutes. 

On the simplest level, when I'm teaching a class, I actually invite my students to help me fix errors that they find in my materials. If I've left out a step in an exercise, or there's a broken link in my readings, they can edit the file themselves and submit the changes for me to review and incorporate. It's a lot more efficient than having them email me suggested changes that I then have to hunt down in the materials! All they need to do that is an account on GitHub and a web browser. (In the workshop, I'll walk through the process of how a student--or anyone else, including you!--would do this.)

The next step, of course, is creating your own repository of materials on GitHub. But before we go there, let's take a break from GitHub, and talk about Slack.
