# Using GitHub

If you're reading this, you're using GitHub. Congratulations! :) 

There are two primary ways to provide non-code content on GitHub. One is to use its built-in web page tools (GitHub Pages) to create a website with your content. The other, which is what I'll be showing, is creating human-readable documents directly in a repository by using a simple markup language called Markdown.
