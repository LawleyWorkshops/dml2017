# 1. Introduction: Understanding GitHub and Slack

Let's start with the basics of what GitHub and Slack are, and what they're used for.

## GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a site where anyone can store a repository (often referred to as a "repo") of documents. While it is most often used to store, share, and collaborate on source code for software projects, repos can include any type of digital file--including human-readable documentation pages like this one!

GitHub gets its name from the software it uses to keep track of files and changes, which is called git. Git is what's known as version control (or source control) software, and it's used to allow developers to keep track of changes that they and others make to files. You can run git on nearly any type of computer--Windows, Mac, Linux, etc--and it's a standard tool for most software developers these days. Git is considered *distributed* version control, which means that each person working with the repository of documents has their own complete copy of the files, which they can sync with any other copy of the repository. Typically, one copy of the repository is placed on a server accessible to all developers, and designated as the primary shared version. Developers modifying the code on their own machines then send their revisions to the copy on the server. 

GitHub is simply a publicly accessible shared server running git, with a web-based interface, which can be used to host both public and private repositories of digital files. Many open source projects are housed on GitHub, allowing anyone to download the most recent version of the software, as well as permitting them to assist with improving the code (don't worry, there are controls over that process!). GitHub isn't the only server offering this functionality, but it's well known and widely used, so it's the one we'll be working with today. 

In today's workshop, we're only going to work with the web-based interface to GitHub, so you won't need to have git installed on your own computer. However, if you end up deciding to regularly publish content on GitHub, it will be important to learn how the underlying git software works, and how to use it on your own computer. My favorite tutorial for this is a James Williamson's [GitHub for Web Designers](https://www.lynda.com/GitHub-tutorials/GitHub-Web-Designers/162276-2.html) tutorial on Lynda.com--unfortunately, it requires a subscription, and could use a litle updating since it was published three years ago. There are many other tutorials available online, however, including [quite a few from GitHub itself](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/). 

Before we go any further, make sure you've created a free GitHub account (if you don't already have one). You can do that by clicking the "Sign Up" link in the top right corner of this page! (If you already have an account, there's no need to create a new one--just sign in with that.)

## Slack

At its core, Slack is a web-based group messaging tool. It provides a group workspace with both public and private channels for discussion, private messaging capability, and file storage. 

Why am I using Slack for this instead of our LMS (or simply sending email)? In addition to all the reasons that I listed for using GitHub rather than an LMS, most LMS chat and messaging tools are rudimentary at best, and tend to add far more frustration than value. As for email--I think we all know how ineffective email can be at reaching students quickly, and encouraging them to interact with teachers and each other on a regular basis. 

There's a lot more to Slack than than messaging, too, which is one of the reasons it has become so wildly popular in business settings. (That's also why, even in the ["What is Slack?"](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) portion of their Getting Started guide, the description is pretty vague!) In particular, Slack can be extended with a wide variety of apps that integrate it with other online services--from Google Docs and Dropbox to Trello and even GitHub. 

Setting up a Slack workspace is free (and we'll look at how to do that in the last section of this workshop), but there are limitations on the free version. Foremost among those is the fact that you are limited to a total of 10,000 messages across the workspace. That may sound like more than you'll ever need--but it includes every private message, every group message, and every message posted by an integrated app. In a large and/or active group, you can hit that 10K message cap faster than you might think--and after that, messages "scroll off the top" in terms of access. (They are preserved in the database, but are inaccessible if you don't upgrade to the paid version.) And unfortunately for teachers, the paid version of Slack is based on a per-user charge, making it unworkable for most academic budgets--even with their extremely generous 85% discount for educational institutions, the cost is $12/year/user. 

Another issue with Slack is that every Slack workspace is a completely separate instantiation on their server, with a separate user ID and password. This can be confusing for users who are already using Slack for other purposes. All of the Slack clients allow you to be logged into multiple workspaces, but it can become confusing to navigate among them, and be aware of which one is currently active. 

There are other options available for combined group and private messaging, of course, but I've chosen to stick with Slack in my classes for several reasons:
- RIT is a co-op education school, which means our students go out on semester-long work experiences several times during their degree. Many of them will end up at companies using Slack, so this gives them hands-on experience with an important productivity tool.
- Slack has excellent mobile clients, which is typically the very best way to reach my students. (As we all know, email is pretty low on the list of ways to get your students' attention quickly.)
- Slack's integrations, especially with Google Docs, GitHub, and Trello, are extremely useful in my classes, where those services are also an important part of the instructional technology used. 
- It's easy for me to add external people to a Slack workspace, which comes in handy when I've got a class working on a project with outside experts. 

One of the biggest drawbacks of using any type of real-time messaging with active groups, of course, is that it can turn into a major source of productivity-killing interruptions. That's why for years I've avoided using it for most work-related activities. However, when I use it with students, itallows me prioritize their questions over the mountains of less important (but still non-spam) email I get every day. To keep that under control, however, the *only* Slack workspaces I check regularly are the ones for my currently active classe--and once the term is over, I stop checking the workspaces entirely. (I'll still respond to former students' questions, of course, but they do lose their "priority access" to me. ) 

Slack will make a lot more sense once you've actually used it yourself, which you'll start doing in section 3. First, however, let's take a closer look at GitHub.
