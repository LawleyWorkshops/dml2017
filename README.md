# Fork Your Syllabus, You Slacker! 
[DML Teach-In, 6 October 2017](https://dml2017.sched.com/event/0f03a40b042cc1a6f4e73a78a62d0305) - Presented by [Liz Lawley](http://lawley.rit.edu/), Rochester Institute of Technology

## Session Description
Have you ever wanted to share materials from your classes with other faculty, but found that your courseware made that nearly impossible? Or wanted a way to easily share your updates and modifications to someone else’s materials? Do you struggle to get students to respond to email? Do you wish you had better options for engaging with students working in groups without being overbearing? 

In this session, I'll show you how you can use GitHub to make your course materials easily accessible, updatable, and shareable—even if they have nothing to do with programming! You’ll learn the basics of how GitHub works, and how to take advantage of their free classroom and student accounts to create private as well as public repositories of content. I’ll also show you how you can use the free version of Slack to create classroom conversation spaces that support class-wide announcements, group conversations for project work, private messaging with students, and easy file sharing. 

## Session Topics

### 1. [GitHub Overview](aboutGithub.md)
GitHub is usually thought of as a place to host and collaborate on repositories ("repos") of software code. How can you use it for distributing class content? And more importantly, why would you want to?

### 2. [Using a GitHub Repo](usingGithub.md)
You're currently using the GitHub repo that I set up for this workshop. Before you create your own, we'll take a quick tour of this one, and of one I use in a non-code-focused freshman class. 

### 3. [Slack Overview](aboutSlack.md)
Slack is used for both private and group messaging. But what does Slack offer that your organization's email and/or learning management system don't already provide? 

### 4. [Using Slack](usingSlack.md)
I've created a Slack workspace for this workshop. We'll begin with that, rather than GitHub, since you'll be able to use Slack throughout the session to ask for help with things we're discussing. 

### 5. [Creating Content on GitHub](creatingGithub.md)
We'll walk through the process of creating a GitHub account (if you don't already have one), creating an "organization" to use for your classes, and applying for an educational discount for your class organization. 

### 6. [Creating a Slack Workspace](creatingSlack.md)
We'll walk through the process of creating and setting up a new Slack workspace for use in a classroom.
