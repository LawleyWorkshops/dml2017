# Fork Your Syllabus, You Slacker! (DML Teach-In, 6 October 2017)

## About this Teach-In

[Session Description](https://dml2017.dmlhub.net/schedule/): Have you ever wanted to share materials from your classes with other faculty, but found that your courseware made that nearly impossible? Or wanted a way to easily share your updates and modifications to someone else’s materials? Do you struggle to get students to respond to email? Do you wish you had better options for engaging with students working in groups without being overbearing? 

In this session, I'll show you how you can use GitHub to make your course materials easily accessible, updatable, and shareable—even if they have nothing to do with programming! You’ll learn the basics of how GitHub works, and how to take advantage of their free classroom and student accounts to create private as well as public repositories of content. I’ll also show you how you can use the free version of Slack to create classroom conversation spaces that support class-wide announcements, group conversations for project work, private messaging with students, and easy file sharing.
