# 1. GitHub Overview

GitHub, at its core, is a site where anyone can store a repository (often referred to as a "repo") of documents. It is most often used to store and share source code for software projects, repos can include any type of digital file. 

GitHub gets its name from the software it uses to keep track of files and changes, which is called git. Git is what's known as version control (or source control) software, and it's used to allow developers to keep track of changes that they and others make to files. You can run git on nearly any type of computer--Windows, Mac, Linux, etc--and it's a standard tool for most software developers these days. Git is considered *distributed* version control, which means that each person working with the repository of documents has their own complete copy of the files, which they can sync with any other copy of the repository. Typically, one copy of the repository is placed on a server accessible to all developers, and designated as the primary shared version. Developers modifying the code on their own machines then send their revisions to the copy on the server. 

GitHub is a publicly accessible shared server running git, which can be used to host repositories for both public and private use. Many open source projects are housed on GitHub, allowing anyone to download the most recent version of the software, as well as permitting them to assist with improving the code (don't worry, there are controls over that process!). GitHub isn't the only server offering this functionality, but it's one of the best known, and the one we'll be working with today. 

If you're going to use GitHub regularly to publish content, it's important to learn how the underlying git software works, and how to use it with a copy of a repo maintained on your own computer. My favorite tutorial for this is a James Williamson's [GitHub for Web Designers](https://www.lynda.com/GitHub-tutorials/GitHub-Web-Designers/162276-2.html) tutorial on Lynda.com--unfortunately, it requires a subscription, and could use a litle updating since it was published three years ago. There are many other tutorials available online, however, including [quite a few from GitHub itself](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/). 

In today's workshop, we're only going to work with the web-based interface to GitHub, so you won't need to have git installed on your own computer, and a lot of the power of its change tracking won't be immediately obvious to you. But it will get you up and running with basic content creation and sharing a lot more quickly!

Before we go any further, make sure you've created a free GitHub account (if you don't already have one). You can do that by going to [GitHub's home page](https://github.com/) and clicking the "Sign Up" link in the top right corner.
