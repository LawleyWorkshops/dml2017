# 3. Slack Overview

At its core, Slack is a web-based group messaging tool. It provides a group workspace with both public and private channels for discussion, private messaging capability, and file storage. 

Why am I using Slack for this instead of our LMS (or simply sending email)? In addition to all the reasons that I listed for using GitHub rather than an LMS, most LMS chat and messaging tools are rudimentary at best, and tend to add far more frustration than value. As for email--I think we all know how ineffective email can be at reaching students quickly, and encouraging them to interact with teachers and each other on a regular basis. 

There's a lot more to Slack than than messaging, too, which is one of the reasons it has become so wildly popular in business settings. (That's also why, even in the ["What is Slack?"](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) portion of their Getting Started guide, the description is pretty vague!) In particular, Slack can be extended with a wide variety of apps that integrate it with other online services--from Google Docs and Dropbox to Trello and even GitHub. 

Setting up a Slack workspace is free (and we'll look at how to do that in the last section of this workshop), but there are limitations on the free version. Foremost among those is the fact that you are limited to a total of 10,000 messages across the workspace. That may sound like more than you'll ever need--but it includes every private message, every group message, and every message posted by an integrated app. In a large and/or active group, you can hit that 10K message cap faster than you might think--and after that, messages "scroll off the top" in terms of access. (They are preserved in the database, but are inaccessible if you don't upgrade to the paid version.) And unfortunately for teachers, the paid version of Slack is based on a per-user charge, making it unworkable for most academic budgets--even with their extremely generous 85% discount for educational institutions, the cost is $12/year/user. 

Another issue with Slack is that every Slack workspace is a completely separate instantiation on their server, with a separate user ID and password. This can be confusing for users who are already using Slack for other purposes. All of the Slack clients allow you to be logged into multiple workspaces, but it can become confusing to navigate among them, and be aware of which one is currently active. 

There are other options available for combined group and private messaging, of course, but I've chosen to stick with Slack in my classes for several reasons:
- RIT is a co-op education school, which means our students go out on semester-long work experiences several times during their degree. Many of them will end up at companies using Slack, so this gives them hands-on experience with an important productivity tool.
- Slack has excellent mobile clients, which is typically the very best way to reach my students. (As we all know, email is pretty low on the list of ways to get your students' attention quickly.)
- Slack's integrations, especially with Google Docs, GitHub, and Trello, are extremely useful in my classes, where those services are also an important part of the instructional technology used. 
- It's easy for me to add external people to a Slack workspace, which comes in handy when I've got a class working on a project with outside experts. 

One of the biggest drawbacks of using any type of real-time messaging with active groups, of course, is that it can turn into a major source of productivity-killing interruptions. That's why I've primarily avoided using it for most work-related activities. However, with students currently taking my classes, I really want a way to be able to prioritize their questions over the mountains of mostly-useless (but still non-spam) email I get every day. Slack lets me do that. The *only* Slack workspaces I subscribe to are the ones for my currently active classes; once the semester is over, I log out of those workspaces completely. 

Getting students to use a new tool can be a challenge, and I've done a couple of things to increase widespread use by my students--I'll cover those in the last section of this workshop, ["Creating a Class Slack Workspace"](creatingSlack.md). 

Slack will make a lot more sense once you've actually used it yourself, so I've created a workspace specifically for this presentation--head to the [next section](usingSlac.md) for instructions on that. (For privacy reasons, I can't do live demos of my class Slacks!)
